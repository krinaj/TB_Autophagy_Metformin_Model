This repository contains supplementary material from the manuscript https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00366-22. The supplementary materials contain parameters and model codes for a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling framework of autophagy in tuberculosis.  The model allows to perform simulations of change in bacterial load following standard TB antibiotics therapy with or without adjunctive metformin as host-directed therapy.
