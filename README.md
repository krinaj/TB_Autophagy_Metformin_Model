This repository contains parameters and simulations codes (R scripts) for a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling framework of autophagy in tuberculosis  described in manuscript the https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.10.483882v1. The model allows to perform simulations of change in bacterial load following standard TB antibiotics therapy with or without adjunctive metformin as host-directed therapy.
